- The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT
- Boolean is a group of commands that are mostly used in almost every search engine, to combine or exclude keywords, etc.
- Boolean logic considers two expressions or statements and apply a logical operator to produce a Boolean value that can be either "true" or "false".

<h1>Decision making in shell scripting</h1>

- In Decision making the programmer provides one or more conditions for the execution of a block of code. 
- If the given conditions are satisfied then that particular block of code is executed. 
- There are two types of decision-making statements that are used in shell scripting. 
     - If-else statement
     - case-sac statement

- If else statements are decision-making statements that are used to select a particular option from a given set of options.
