<h1>Boolean operators in shell scripting</h1>

- The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT
- Boolean is a group of commands that are mostly used in almost every search engine, to combine or exclude keywords, etc.
- Boolean logic considers two expressions or statements and apply a logical operator to produce a Boolean value that can be either "true" or "false". 

**Code example for boolean operators:**

<h1>Decision making in shell scripting</h1>

- In Decision making the programmer provides one or more conditions for the execution of a block of code. 
- If the given conditions are satisfied then that particular block of code is executed. 
- There are two types of decision-making statements that are used in shell scripting. 
     - if-else statement
     - case-sac statement

<h1>The if-else statements</h1>

- If else statements are decision-making statements that are used to select a particular option from a given set of options.
- Unix Shell supports the following types of if-else statements.
    - if-fi statement
    - if-else-fi statement
    - if-elif-else-fi statement

**Codeblock for if-fi statement:**

**Codeblock for if-else-fi statement:**
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/if-else-fi.sh

**Codeblock for if-elif-else-fi statement:**
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/if-elif-else-fi.sh


<h1>Challenges faced</h1>
Learning if-else statement went smooth but case-sac statement which eliminates the usage of multiple if-elif statements seems to be bit confusing for me. I will be going through other tutorials and continue with the same in the next blog.
