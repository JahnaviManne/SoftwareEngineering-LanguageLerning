Language: "Shell Scripting"
What exactly is Shell Scripting:  "Shell scripting is nothing but a set of instructions that are piled up in a single file to perform specific tasks without any manual interaction. This is called an automated process."
Why did I choose Shell Scripting: "Now a days, each and every project in an organization is designed and developed in such a way that all the tasks it performs eliminate manual intervention. This is because, automation makes the development and deployment of the application easier and faster thus helping in developers and operations collaboreation easier."
