<h1>Arrays in shell scripting</h1>

- Shell scripting accomodates a special kind of variable called an "array variable"
- The array variable of shell can hold multiple values at the same time.
- Arrays provide a strategy for grouping a set of variables.

<h1>Accessing and reading array values sequentially</h1>

- All the array elements can be accessed by specifying the array index.
- Looping concepts (for loop and while loop) can also be used for reading array elements

**Codeblock for accessing and reading array values:** "https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/accessing_array.sh", "https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/looping_through_array.sh"
