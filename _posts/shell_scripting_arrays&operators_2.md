Title: Arrays and Basic Operators

<h1>Arrays in shell scripting</h1>

- Shell scripting accomodates a special kind of variable called an "array variable"
- The array variable of shell can hold multiple values at the same time.
- Arrays provide a strategy for grouping a set of variables.

<h1>Accessing and reading array values sequentially</h1>

- All the array elements can be accessed by specifying the array index.
- Looping concepts (for loop and while loop) can also be used for reading array elements

**Codeblocks for accessing and reading array values:** 
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/accessing_array.sh
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/looping_through_array.sh


<h1>Basic operators in shell scripting</h1>

Shell supports 5 basic operators, namely:
- Arithmetic operator ('+', '-', '*', '%', '=', '==', '!=')
- Relational Operators ('-eq', '-ne', '-gt', '-lt', '-ge', '-le')
- Boolean Operators ('!', '-o', '-a')
- String Operators ('=', '!=', 'str')

**Codeblock for performing basic arithemetic operations:** 
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/arithemetic_operators.sh

**Codeblock for performing basic relational operations:** 
- https://github.com/JahnaviManne/SoftwareEngineering-LanguageLerning/blob/main/relational_operators.sh


<h1>Challenges faced so far</h1>
- I faced a little difficulty while practicing and executing code for "boolean operators". I will be reading a bit more about it, practice, execute and document it in the next blog.
