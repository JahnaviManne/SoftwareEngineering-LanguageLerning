<h1>How did I start</h1>
I started going through many online resources for learning shell scripting and came accross <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/"/a> which I found very well aggregated and defined with all the concepts of shell scripting.

Installation:
There are no additional packages that are required for executing shell scripts. Shell scripting can be executed by creating a file with ".sh" extenstion and adding "#!/bin/bash" at the very first line of the file"
