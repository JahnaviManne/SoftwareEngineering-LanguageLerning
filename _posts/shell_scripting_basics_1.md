<h1>How did I start</h1>
I started going through many online resources for learning shell scripting and came accross "https://www.javatpoint.com/" which I found very well aggregated and defined with all the concepts of shell scripting.  

**Installation:**
There are no additional packages that are required for executing shell scripts. Shell scripting can be executed by creating a file with ".sh" extenstion and adding "#!/bin/bash" at the very first line of the file"

<h1>Variables in shell scripting</h1>

- A variable in shell scripting is nothing but a pointer to the data. In shell scripting, we can create, assign, and delete variables respectively.
- The name of a variable can contain just letters (a to z or a to z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character (_).
- For accessing the value stored in a variable, we need to prefix the name of the variable with the dollar sign ($).
