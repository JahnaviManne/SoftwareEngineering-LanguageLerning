<h1>Skills from the learning language I utilized to work on mini project</h1>

- Shell loops and commands that I have learned helped me to automate the processes such as installation of database, apache server, etc.
- File permissions helped me to understand and provide priveleges to various commands in the scripting.


<h1>Additional skills/knowledge I had learned to complete the tasks</h1>

- Co-ordinating with team members to understand their code and setting up the local working model before automation.
- SSH connectivity to the EC2 machine created through terraform and adjusting the security groups for accessing the applications running on different ports.
- Mixing up different technologies to prepare a working model.


<h1>Challenges faced</h1>

- Dependecy (application specific) issues with different operating systems and versions of it. (Ubuntu, Mac OS)
- Modifying configurations in the required files using shell script.
