<h1>case-esac statement in shell scripting</h1>

- The principal syntax of the case-esac statement is to give an expression to evaluate and to execute different statements based on the value of the expression.
- The interpreter goes through each case against the value of the expression until it finds a match.
- If nothing matches, a default condition will be used.

**Code example for case-esac statement:**

<h1>Shell loops</h1>

- A loop is an insightful programming tool that helps us to execute set of commands recursively.
- The following types of loops exist in shell scripting.
      - for loop
      - while loop
      - until loop
      - select loop

<h1>Nesting Loops</h1>

- All the above loops support nesting concept.
- Nesting concept means that you can put one loop inside the other loop. 
- This nesting concept can go up to unlimited number of executions based on our requirement.

<h1>for loop</h1>
